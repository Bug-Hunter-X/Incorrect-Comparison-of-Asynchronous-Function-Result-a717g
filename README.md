This example demonstrates a common error in DApps involving asynchronous operations. The `getBalance` function, which interacts with the blockchain, returns a promise.  Directly comparing the promise to a numerical value is incorrect and always evaluates to false because a Promise is not less than a number.  The solution demonstrates the proper use of `async/await` to ensure the function resolves before the comparison is made.  This pattern is crucial for handling asynchronous operations in DApps.
